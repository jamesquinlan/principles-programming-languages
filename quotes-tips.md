## Quotes

1. "_Whatever you undertake, act with prudence and consider the consequences_" - Anon

3. "_The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct._"

4. "_I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits._"
― Kent Beck
