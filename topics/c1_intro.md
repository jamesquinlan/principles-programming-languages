# Introduction

> Thought is not merely expressed in words, it comes into existence through them - Lev Vygotsky.

> How we program influences how we think about computation and vice-versa - Louden & Lambert.

We introduce the principles and concepts underlying programming languages.  It is not about specific programming languages, however, specific languages are used to illustrate these principles and concepts.  

## Goals
* Introduce notions of programming languages
* Outline basic concepts

### Prerequisite
* Knowledge and experience with at least one languge
* Knowledge of common data structures
* General knowledge of computational process(es) for problem solving
