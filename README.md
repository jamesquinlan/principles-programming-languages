# Programming Languages Principles and Concepts

Introduction to the fundamental concepts of formal languages, as well as the evolution and characteristics of major programming languages. Topics include finite-state automata, regular expressions, parsing, syntax and semantics, scope and binding, data types, and abstract data types.  

Principles and techniques of high level programming language specification, including syntax and semantics, and implementation methods. Languages are considered as formal constructs representing computable functions and the course presents basic results of computability theory. Methods of recognition for regular and context free languages, the functional alternative to the state based imperative paradigm, use of parse trees as control constructs, and concurrent programming synchronization primitives are also covered.




### Prerequisite
* Knowledge and experience with at least one languge (e.g., C, C++, Java)
* Knowledge of common data structures
* General knowledge of computational process(es) for problem solving




## Principles and Techniques of Programming Languages

**Syntax and Semantics**: Every programming language has its own syntax and semantics that define the rules for writing valid programs and their meaning, respectively. Syntax defines the structure and grammar of the language, while semantics defines the behavior of programs written in that language.

**Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features of a programming language. It allows programmers to work at a higher level of abstraction, making it easier to write correct and maintainable code.

**Data Types**: A programming language defines different data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and arrays, among others. These data types provide a way to represent different kinds of data in a program.

**Control Structures**: Control structures are the building blocks of a programming language that allow programmers to control the flow of execution in a program. Examples of control structures include conditional statements, loops, and function calls.

**Memory Management**: Memory management is the process of allocating and deallocating memory for variables and data structures in a program. A programming language can provide different memory management techniques, such as garbage collection or manual memory management.

**Concurrency**: Concurrency is the ability of a programming language to handle multiple tasks or threads at the same time. A programming language can provide different synchronization primitives such as locks, semaphores, and monitors to manage concurrent access to shared resources.

**Object-Oriented Programming**: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects and classes to organize and structure code. It provides encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to enable code reuse and maintainability.
