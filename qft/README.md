# Question Formulation Technique (QFT)

> Asking the right question is an advanced skill.


Using QFT in the classroom encourages all students to participate in investigation and discussion, fostering a growth mindset and a collaborative learning environment.  Not only does QFT provide opportunities for all voices to be heard, which is a requirement for engagement and a condition for effective group problem-solving, but it also serves as a formative assessment tool.

QFT supports the development of transferable skills that are essential for success in the field of computer science.
